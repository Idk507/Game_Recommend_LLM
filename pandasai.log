This does not mean that the game is not a blast: it is actually the first card game I've played for so long and with so much enjoyment.

Less than 5 hours of my life as Geralt was spent on Gwent, triple triad in FFXIV does nothing for me and I actively despised Joustus in king of cards. I'm also not a big fan of mobile games as they are typically shallow affairs that never hold my attention. So for Marvel snap to be my most played game to release in 2022 and a near ever-present in my daily life, they must have got something right. The key to marvel snap is that its easy to pick up and hard to master. Each card is both a part of marvel's illustrious history and a chess piece that can change the game if used correctly. A game of marvel snap lasts less than 5 minutes so it's easy to justify trying different combination of cards as picking cards with poor synergy will not cost you much. The process of developing  wining decks is as satisfying as learning the ropes in any fighting game. The games various locations that impact each match only add to the complexity as you alter your strategy based on there affects as well as your opponents moves. The snap is a genius mechanic that forces you to either call there bluff or fold like its a high stake poker game.  The ability to upgrade your cards, so they are 3D holographic brings back childhood memories , alongside giving the game a engaging gameplay loop. Upgrading your cards, daily challenges and season challenges keep me coming back day after day.  Not being able to buy unique cards is one of the best decisions the devs ever made and allows me to come back day after day unlocking new cards, getting a holographic card collection my childhood self could only dream of and switching between strategies to keep the game fresh is a wining formula  where the marvel licence is only  the cherry on top of a delicious cake."", ""A card game with simple mechanics. Easy to get into difficult to master. You'll be surprised how many diverse decks you can come up with, with ass simple cards this game offers. Each match takes about 2 minutes or so and every match feels unique enough to keep you engaged in its core gameplay loop."", 'Marvel Snap is a bit like Destiny 2, Apex Legends, and many others in the “game as a service” category: a great game you probably shouldn’t play.\n                     \n                     There is no denying that Marvel Snap is astoundingly great at being a quick and flashy 2-player card battler: card effects are superbly designed, so that almost every cards feels powerful and great to play; decks are exactly 12 cards, so it’s easy to deckbuild, experiment, and try many different strategies; and, at exactly 6 turns, each game is snappy I got used to firing up the matchmaking every time I have to go downstairs to grab a food delivery — and I live in the second story on my building. Win or lose, you’ll play your cards, watch their flashy effects, and have your dopamine hit. It really does feel great.\n                     \n                     Not to mention one of the best parts of the design, the titular snapping mechanic: with one tap, you can stake your progression with a “double or nothing” gamble. No matter if you’re really confident or just bluffing, the other player either needs to call it or concede defeat. This creates tension like a motherfucker.\n                     \n                     So let me get this straight, you’re thinking. Snap looks stunning, is polished to a shine, and feels genuinely great to play. What’s the problem?\n                     \n                     The price.\n                     \n                     By 2023, it’s basically a cliché to say free-to-play games are the most expensive in the market. Everyone knows that. Snap is no different. You will download the game for free, sure, but you will pay — if not with money, than with the bad feeling of playing a lesser game than everyone else, and having to grind more to be less competitive. You’ll always be behind on the new cards, and every game you lose will remind you this problema can be solved with your credit card.\n                     \n                     Just get it, you’ll think. It’s just the price of an indie game per month to keep on top of the Season Passes, you’ll think. It won’t bankrupt me, you’ll think. I don’t even have time to play a new indie game every month to completion. This game brings me fun consistently. I like Marvel heroes! Pretend it’s a subscription! You’ll think all of these things and others to justify continuously spending time on intangible items that would have been unlockable through gameplay if this was a good old regular paid game as god intended.\n                     \n                     And then one day you’ll write a review on Marvel Snap on Letterboxd and, as you write, you’ll realize what an idiot you’ve been to think this was okay. And you will decide, right then and there, while writing the penultimate paragraph, to just uninstall Snap and get a new indie game instead.\n                     \n                     I think I’ll start with Pizza Tower. Yeah. :) I hear great things, and it’s even cheaper than a Snap season pass.\n                     \n                     Now that feels great.\n                     \n                     …\n                     \n                     I once heard that the act of writing is in itself the act of thinking, just a bit slower and more methodical. I can now state with confidence: that tracks.', ""I played this game every day between October 1 and February 7. The gameplay of Snap is excellent, and for a while the treadmill is really enticing—I earned new cards at a pace and in an order that successfully sparked some inspiration in the new combos I could try. When that happened, I could play dozens of games whittling the new deck and strategy down, until I got something new that did the same thing, and so on. As deck variety increases so does strategic complexity, and the game is excellent at getting you time and opportunity to explore its systems; there's not many explicit tutorials, but the card effects are simple and the at your decks grows feels so natural. It must be said the card game itself feels really well-designed and balanced, and for many characters right on theme. I had a great time for a long time.""]",20K,564,480,470

The game also lacks the special level of polish and attention to detail that nintendo puts in smash as well, which just makes the overall experience underwhelming.

Link can travel anywhere and be equipped with weapons and armor found throughout the world to grant him various bonuses. Unlike many games in the series, Breath of the Wild does not impose a specific order in which quests or dungeons must be completed. While the game still has environmental obstacles such as weather effects, inhospitable lands, or powerful enemies, many of them can be overcome using the right method. A lot of critics ranked Breath of the Wild as one of the best video games of all time.","['Great but I hate the cheap one hit kill QTEs.

(1999), and Year of the Dragon (2000).","[""a well-meaning but ultimately underwhelming attempt at giving sony a super smash brothers equivalent. Unlike a lot of other criticisms towards the game, I think that the roster isn't exactly the worst. Yeah, theres no crash, spyro, solid snake, or cloud, but they got a lot of other interesting games represented by both characters and stages, which is honestly really cool in the same way getting an unknown thing in smash is. You get to learn a lil bit more about sonys various IPs that you might not have otherwise known, I guess. Gameplaywise though this is definitely not smash brothers. You can only score points and defeat players by using super moves which makes most of the actual fighting kinda feel like irrelevant filler...? The game also lacks the special level of polish and attention to detail that nintendo puts in smash as well, which just makes the overall experience underwhelming. However, I'd still say this is worth at least a curious play, since especially with modern sony being the party poopers that hate fun with the playstations legacy of IPs, we ain't seeing most of the first-party characters in this game ever comin back. It's kinda like nintendo land in like getting that last little table scrap of content for neglected IPs that I enjoy. I'm glad this game came out when it did because if they did this concept again now it'd have the most uninspired roster known to man, mark my words."", 'Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale needs another chance... and maybe this time give us characters actually enjoyable to play as.', 'better than smash because it has isaac clarke', ""Most of the characters in this game are mass murders but they all still get bodied by Sly's first special move."", 'A party game and nothing else of value.', 'no,just no.']",3.3K,281,643,309
